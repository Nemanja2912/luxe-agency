        <h4>1. Refund Policy</h4>

        <div>
          <h5>Payment Terms</h5>
          <p>
            The invoice amount is due and payable as specified in the invoice.
            Payment can be made via the designated payment methods stated on the
            invoice.
          </p>
          <h5>Deposit </h5>
          <p>
            A deposit amount may be required for certain goods or services. The
            deposit paid is refundable subject to the conditions outlined below.
          </p>
          <h5>Refund Policy </h5>
          <p>
            The deposit paid is refundable within a period of 48 hours from the
            time of payment, provided that the following conditions are met:
          </p>
          <p>
            a) Request for Refund: To initiate a refund, the customer must
            submit a written refund request within the specified 48-hour
            timeframe. The request must include the relevant invoice details and
            the reason for the refund.
          </p>
          <p>
            b) Eligibility: Refunds will only be granted if the deposit has not
            been utilized towards the completion of the agreed-upon goods or
            services. If any portion of the deposit has been applied or
            consumed, the refund will be adjusted accordingly.
          </p>

          <p>
            c) Refund Process: Once the refund request is received and reviewed,
            we will process the refund within a reasonable time period. The
            refund will be issued using the original payment method whenever
            possible. However, alternative refund methods may be utilized at our
            discretion.
          </p>
          <p>
            d) Non-Transferable: Refunds are non-transferable and can only be
            issued to the original payee mentioned on the invoice. Third-party
            refund requests will not be entertained.
          </p>
          <h5>Expiry of Refund Eligibility </h5>
          <p>
            After the initial 48-hour period has elapsed, the deposit becomes
            non-refundable. No refund requests will be accepted beyond this
            timeframe, and the deposit will be deemed fully utilized towards the
            outstanding balance or services rendered.
          </p>
          <h5>Amendment or Cancellation </h5>
          <p>
            Any changes or cancellations to the goods or services covered by
            this invoice must be communicated in writing within the specified
            timeframes and are subject to our approval. Amendments or
            cancellations may impact the refund eligibility of the deposit, as
            determined by the terms outlined above.
          </p>
          <h5>Dispute Resolution </h5>
          <p>
            In the event of a dispute or disagreement regarding the refund
            request, both parties agree to attempt to resolve the matter through
            good faith negotiations. If no resolution can be reached, the
            parties may seek mediation or pursue other legal remedies available
